TL;DR Crohn's disease sucks, you lose who you are as person.  You don't have a choice but to be better as a person. Hope for it and work toward it, then give back.
I've got Crohn's too.  The first few years when symptoms showed up were probably some of the worst in my life.  I had just started college when my stomach aches and fatigue were coming on.  I had just chalked it up to dining hall food being lower quality cuz my symptoms went away when I went home and ate fresh food my family cooked.  
After two years of struggling through the stomach aches that were increasingly common and painful, the fatigue that was becoming more and more debilitating, the run-around with my doctors (go to x,y,z specialist, it's lupus, it's not lupus, its rheumatoid arthiritis, its not rheumatoid arthiritis) I was finally diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis.  I was able to get treatment, but I wasn't getting much better.  
This disease takes more than just a physical toll on you, it cost me my relationships.  I had a hard time making friends because its college, "hey lets party and get drunk and eat Taco Bell late at night", well I can't do that because something is wrong with me and for two years I didn't know why.  Even when I did know why, it didn't mean that I could obliterate my stomach like that.  18- 22 yr olds don't get that.  The pain and fatigue take their mental and emotional toll too.  I was irritable and snappy toward my loved ones.  My girlfriend broke up with me.  I couldn't focus in class because I was always hungry and in pain and some of my professors were not in the least bit understanding.  I had an entire letter grade drop because "I should have notified [the professor] ahead of time when [I] would be late due to illness".  Asshole.
The third year after my first symptoms appeared I was put on a steroid treatment.  No one told me that it would mess with your head.  On top of the break-up, horrible grades,  health problems, and whatever the steroids were doing to my head I had a mental breakdown.  I don't know how I managed to scrape by, I barely passed.  I was crying every day and waking up feeling anxious - my arms were tingling from stress.  My parents were not thrilled when I said I was not going to return to school in the spring - they said "why can't you be like the others and enjoy the best years of your life" when we went to pack my shit up.  I had to fight them to go to the therapist and to get anti-depressants.
Almost a year after with minimal improvement, I got another colonoscopy.  Bad news - We misdiagnosed you.  Good news - the docs said for certain its Crohns.  I got put on humira and finally was able to get back on track health wise. Kinda.
I returned to school that summer, switched majors to Information Systems.  Things started to pick up.  I could eat, and exercise, and party a little bit!  I could focus again!  The shit i'm learning is kinda cool, and challenging.  The pain and discomfort were still there but I could manage!  I had thought it was all good, and then I got another flare.  I lost another semester (I managed to finish the semester, but it was not fun.  Another relationship also ended, friends were distant) and another summer of my life lounging about not being able to do more than to get up eat toast and drink some tea.  Couldn't even watch t.v.   My doctor's doubled my dose of humira, and since then its the closest to normal I have been.
Reflecting on the past, I learned a lot of myself.  I learned that life is not fair and if I want to have a decent standard of health I'm going to have to work harder than most.  Meaning I need to workout, watch my diet (r/loseit, r/MealPrepSunday, r/bodyweightfitness - you all are homies), and I had to push myself through school to get a good job to pay for my medicine (No one should ever have to depend on medical care through their profession  - this is bullshit here in the States).  I have become more sympathetic towards others and grown as a person.  I volunteer now.  I am politically active - I write to my representatives voicing concerns often.  I try to be engaged in the world.  It keeps me on track (kinda how pets force you to be better and responsible, know what I mean?).  I am grateful for everything I have.  If you asked me five years ago that I would be able to overcome this and be a better person than what I was before, with friends, finishing school, and getting a job I wouldn't have believed you!  The ups wouldn't have been so high if the downs weren't so bottomless-ly low.  But there is still work to be done, and I have to be more careful than most people.
The unfortunate truth is that you don't get a choice to take a vacation from this awful disease.  You do however have a choice to become your own version of superman and fight to become so much more than what you were before.  To my understanding there is no guarantee of remission or even sustaining it, but the opportunity of getting your life back is worth the fight!  Just give back to your community once you've gotten back on that horse, it'll definitely keep you motivated to stay on it.  Trust me on that.  Good luck and ask for help whenever you need it.
